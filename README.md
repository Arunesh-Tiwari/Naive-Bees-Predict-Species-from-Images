# Naive-Bees-Predict-Species-from-Images
We will be working through a Driven Data Competition to identify Honey Bees and Bumble Bees given an image of these insects! To learn more about the background, you can explore the competition page.For this project, the documentation for scikit-learn, scikit-image, and numpy will be helpful resources! For more information about bees, see the BeeSpotter project or the DrivenData competition.The recommended prerequisites for this Project are Intermediate Python, Introduction to Data Visualization with Matplotlib, Supervised Learning with scikit-learn, and Na√Øve Bees: Image Loading and Processing.
